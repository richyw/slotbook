# slotbook

## Purpose
This is meant to be an organizational tool for skis in a high volume ski shop. Ski work orders are completed on paper, and each have a unique work order number. After work on the ski has been completed it is filed into a slot. This package will allow employees to search for the skis by the work order number, last name of the customer, or brand and display the slot it is in. It will also allow the employee to mark the ski as picked up.

## Goal
The eventual goal for the First version is to have a GUI set up on a raspberry pi, which will allow the ski techs to add work orders, search for the slot number (by work order number, last name) and mark them as picked up. The information will be saved on a local sqlite database

## Future plans
The project can be later expanded to add special notes about a work order, recommend a slot, access the database from a remote computer, and display information about the progress of a work order (tuneups)
